# temperature
wheat >20
rice >30
corn >30

-> Adjust Ventilation:
If possible, increase ventilation to promote air circulation and help dissipate heat. Adequate ventilation is essential for preventing the formation of hotspots within the storage.

-> Activate Cooling Systems:
Activate or enhance cooling systems within the facility to lower the temperature. This could involve adjusting thermostat settings or increasing the capacity of cooling equipment.



# moisture
wheat >16
rice >18
corn >18

-> Enhance Ventilation:
Improve ventilation to enhance air circulation within the facility. Proper airflow helps in reducing humidity levels and preventing the development of moisture pockets

-> Dehumidification Systems:
Implement or optimize dehumidification systems to actively reduce moisture levels in the air. Ensure that the systems are properly functioning and can handle the storage capacity.



# oxygen
wheat >4
rice >5
corn >5

-> Ventilation Improvement:
Enhance ventilation within the facility to promote air exchange and reduce oxygen levels. Proper airflow is essential for preventing the accumulation of oxygen and minimizing the risk of combustion.

-> Inert Gas Injection:
Consider the injection of inert gases, such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide, into the storage environment. Inert gases displace oxygen and create an atmosphere less conducive to combustion.

-> Implement Integrated Pest Management (IPM):
Adopt an integrated approach that combines preventive measures, monitoring, and judicious use of non-chemical controls to manage pests effectively without relying solely on pesticides.

-> Rotate Stored Wheat:
Implement a regular rotation schedule for stored wheat. Older grains are more susceptible to pests, and rotating stocks helps prevent prolonged storage periods.
